# Discord-JS-Chicken-Game
just plug this into your main script using
`require("./chicken-game.js")(client)`
then put it in any command and just access the `client.chicken(message);` function.

if anything breaks please report to me as i just ripped this out of my bot hue which has a bunch of built in functions.
